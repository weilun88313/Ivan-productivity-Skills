# Twitter Content Examples by Category

## Educational Content

### Example 1: Framework Thread
```
1/ The 3-Step Content Creation Framework that 10x'd my engagement:

Most creators focus on what to say. The best focus on how their audience will feel.

Here's the system:

2/ Step 1: Choose Your Emotion

Every post should trigger ONE emotion:
• Inspiration ("I want that")
• Curiosity ("Tell me more")
• Validation ("Finally, someone gets it")
• Surprise ("I didn't know that")

Pick one. Optimize for it.

3/ Step 2: Open With Outcome

Don't start with context. Start with the result.

Bad: "I spent 3 years studying productivity..."
Good: "I condensed 3 years of productivity research into 5 rules:"

People scroll for answers, not stories.

4/ Step 3: End With Activation

Every thread needs an action step:
• Reply with [answer]
• Try this [specific thing]
• Share if you [agree/learned]

Passive reading = forgetting. Active participation = memory.

5/ That's it.

Emotion → Outcome → Action.

Simple system, powerful results.

## Thought Leadership

"Work-life balance" is terrible advice for anyone trying to build something meaningful.

Here's why balance is the wrong goal (and what to aim for instead):
```

**Performance Drivers**:

- Challenges conventional wisdom
- Hook creates disagreement → engagement
- Promise of alternative solution

### Example 2: Observation
```
The most successful people I know have one thing in common:

- Quotable final line
- Insight-dense (high dwell time)
- Shareable wisdom

2/ [Resource Name]: [What it teaches]

Why it's valuable: [Specific outcome]
Where to find it: [Link or search term]

[Continue for each resource]

N/ All of these are completely free.

Which one will you start with?
```

**Performance Drivers**:
- Massive value proposition (free)
- Contrasts with expensive alternative
- Each item actionable
- High bookmark/save rate

```
Twitter growth isn't complicated:

1. Post consistently (daily minimum)
2. Engage genuinely (not transactionally)
3. Add value first (no asks)
4. Be patient (6-12 months)

Everyone wants the hack. The hack is doing the basics longer than everyone else.
```

**Performance Drivers**:
