# Visual Style Guide for Blog Images

ALL generated images must strictly follow this style system using the **5-Paragraph Prompt Template**.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Use Complete 5-Paragraph Template

All image generation prompts MUST follow this exact structure. Do not use simplified prompts.

### Why the 5-Paragraph Template?

- ✅ **Consistency**: Ensures all images maintain the Linear dark mode aesthetic
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Prevents UI elements, dashboards, and literal representations
- ✅ **Precise Styling**: Guarantees accurate color (#6B75FF), environment, and composition
- ✅ **AI Guidance**: Provides comprehensive constraints that eliminate common mistakes

## Cover Image Style

Cover images are **purely abstract** — NO text, NO UI, NO literal depictions. Translate the article's theme into visual metaphor.

### Cover Image Template (Standardized)

Only **one variable**: replace `{BLOG_TITLE}` with the article title. Do NOT modify any other part of the template.

```
Style: Abstract high-tech cover art, inspired by "Linear" app design. Dark mode UI, minimalist, clean, futuristic.

Color Palette: Primary glowing light is hex code #6B75FF (neon violet-blue indigo). Soft, diffused glow on deep charcoal background.

Key content to be displayed: {BLOG_TITLE}

Do not render these words as text. Translate the meaning into glowing geometric data streams, interconnected nodes, floating frosted glass shapes, and abstract light trails. Composition representing data flow in a sophisticated system.

Environment: Deep black void. Very subtle, barely visible isometric grid fading into darkness. Shallow depth of field with soft bokeh effects on distant pathway nodes.

Negative Constraints: NO TEXT, NO LETTERS, NO WORDS, NO CHARACTERS, NO UI ELEMENTS, NO DASHBOARDS, NO CHARTS. Purely abstract visual shapes and light compositions.
```

---

## Inline Image Style

Inline images visualize specific concepts within the article — more structured and informational than covers, but still abstract.

### 5-Paragraph Template for Inline Images

```
Style: [Type of visualization - e.g., "Technical data visualization", "Conceptual segmentation schematic", "Abstract data flow visualization"] inspired by Linear design system. Dark mode, minimalist, clean conceptual schematic.

Color Palette: Deep charcoal background (#1a1a1a), [secondary elements - e.g., "matte grey data structures", "flowing streams"], #6B75FF (violet-blue) accent for [active elements - e.g., "active data points and connections", "high-priority signals", "key highlights"].

Concept: [DETAILED ABSTRACT CONCEPT DESCRIPTION - e.g., "Floating clusters of data cards suspended in dark void. Three distinct groups representing different data types. Interconnected by thin glowing lines."]. Create [desired visual effect - e.g., "layered depth with foreground sharp, background blurred", "sense of continuous flow", "structured hierarchy"].

Keywords Allowed: [Specify minimal text - e.g., "Simple labels only—'Data', 'Analysis', 'Insights'", "Time labels only—'Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3'"]. Clean, legible sans-serif. NO paragraphs of text.

Environment: Deep [background type - e.g., "charcoal void with extremely subtle technical grid", "black background with motion blur", "void with concentric circles"]. [Depth cue - e.g., "No horizon line", "Subtle depth of field"].

Negative Constraints: NO product UI chrome, NO navigation bars, NO sidebars, NO browser frames, NO dashboard widgets, NO fake app interfaces, NO [concept-specific constraints - e.g., "pie charts", "traditional line charts", "literal avatars"].
```

### Inline Image Categories & Examples

#### 1. Data Cluster Visualization

**Use Case**: Showing grouped information, data organization, categorization

**Example Prompt**:
```
Style: Technical data visualization inspired by Linear design system. Dark mode, minimalist, clean conceptual schematic.

Color Palette: Deep charcoal background (#1a1a1a), matte grey data structures, #6B75FF (violet-blue) accent for active data points and connections.

Concept: Floating clusters of pre-event intelligence data cards suspended in dark void. Three distinct groups: attendee profile cluster (left), exhibitor analysis cluster (center), venue layout cluster (right). Interconnected by thin glowing #6B75FF lines showing data relationships. Each cluster contains stacked translucent information cards with minimal geometric icons—small purple status dots indicating data completeness. Subtle glow emanating from active connections.

Keywords Allowed: Simple labels only—"Attendee Data", "Exhibitors", "Venue". Clean, legible sans-serif. NO paragraphs of text.

Environment: Deep charcoal void with extremely subtle technical grid lines barely visible in background. No horizon line.

Negative Constraints: NO product UI chrome, NO navigation bars, NO sidebars, NO browser frames, NO dashboard widgets, NO fake app interfaces.
```

**Result**: Structured floating data clusters (475KB)

---

#### 2. Data Flow Visualization

**Use Case**: Showing real-time processes, movement, dynamic systems

**Example Prompt**:
```
Style: Abstract real-time data flow visualization inspired by Linear aesthetic. Dark mode, dynamic, flowing composition.

Color Palette: Deep charcoal background, flowing data streams in matte grey with #6B75FF highlights for high-priority signals.

Concept: Living data streams flowing from left to right across the frame—representing real-time event intelligence. Multiple parallel streams of varying thickness, each stream composed of small geometric particles (circles, diamonds, hexagons) moving at different velocities. Key insight nodes pulse with #6B75FF glow as data passes through them. Thin connecting lines branch off from main streams to floating analysis nodes. Create sense of continuous information flow and pattern recognition happening in real-time.

Keywords Allowed: Minimal labels—"Foot Traffic", "Engagement", "Leads". Tiny, clean text integrated into the flow.

Environment: Deep black background with subtle motion blur on particles suggesting speed. No grid—pure void emphasizing movement.

Negative Constraints: NO UI elements, NO charts with axes, NO dashboard frames, NO static graphs. Pure flowing abstract visualization.
```

**Result**: Flowing particle streams with motion blur (452KB)

---

#### 3. Segmentation/Targeting Visualization

**Use Case**: Showing audience segments, categorization, targeting

**Example Prompt**:
```
Style: Conceptual segmentation schematic inspired by Linear design. Dark mode, structured but abstract.

Color Palette: Deep charcoal background, target groups in slightly lighter matte grey, #6B75FF highlights for high-value prospects.

Concept: Abstract representation of prospect segmentation—multiple distinct geometric clusters (circles within circles, nested hexagons) floating at different depths in dark space. Largest cluster at center glows with #6B75FF representing high-value targets. Surrounding satellite clusters in matte grey represent different audience segments. Thin connecting lines show relationships and data flow between segments. Small icons floating near each cluster—briefcase, star, tag—indicating segment attributes. Create layered depth with foreground clusters sharp, background clusters slightly blurred.

Keywords Allowed: Segment labels only—"High-Value", "Qualified", "Nurture". Minimal, clean typography.

Environment: Deep void with barely visible concentric circles suggesting targeting reticle. Subtle depth of field.

Negative Constraints: NO pie charts, NO bar graphs, NO dashboard UI, NO literal customer avatars, NO photographs. Purely geometric abstraction.
```

**Result**: Layered geometric cluster visualization (495KB)

---

#### 4. Temporal/Historical Visualization

**Use Case**: Showing trends over time, evolution, progression

**Example Prompt**:
```
Style: Temporal data evolution visualization inspired by Linear aesthetic. Dark mode, flowing progression.

Color Palette: Deep charcoal background, data points in matte grey evolving to glowing #6B75FF showing improvement over time.

Concept: Abstract representation of performance improvement over time—three to four vertical columns of stacked data nodes progressing from left (past) to right (present). Leftmost column: smaller, dimmer matte grey nodes loosely organized. Progressive columns: nodes grow larger, brighter, more organized, culminating in rightmost column glowing with #6B75FF showing optimized performance. Flowing light trails connect corresponding nodes across time periods, showing evolution trajectory. Floating geometric shapes above each column represent key learnings extracted from that time period.

Keywords Allowed: Time labels only—"Q1 2025", "Q2 2025", "Q3 2025", "Q4 2025". Minimal clean text.

Environment: Deep black void with subtle horizontal timeline running beneath the columns. No traditional chart axes—pure conceptual flow.

Negative Constraints: NO traditional line charts, NO bar graphs, NO dashboard UI, NO grid backgrounds with numbers. Abstract temporal flow only.
```

**Result**: Temporal progression with glowing evolution (499KB)
