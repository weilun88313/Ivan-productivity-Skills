# LinkedIn Post Templates & Structures

This document provides proven post structures and templates for different content types.

## Core Post Structures

### Template 1: Personal Story → Insight
**Best for**: Sharing experiences and lessons learned

**Structure**:
```
[Hook: Describe a specific situation or moment]

[Story: What happened - 2-3 sentences]

[Transition: What this taught me / made me realize]

[Insight: Core lesson or takeaway - 2-3 points]

[Closing: Invitation to engage or final thought]
```

**Example**:
```
An intern asked me a question last week that stopped the entire room.

"Why are we spending 3 weeks perfecting a feature only 2% of users will touch?"

That moment made me realize:
• We often chase perfection at the cost of priority
• Sometimes outside perspective beats internal experience
• Courage doesn't come from seniority—it comes from authenticity

The best teams aren't the ones where everyone says "yes."

They're the ones where people feel safe asking "why."

Ever had a moment like this on your team? 💭
```

### Template 2: Observation → Analysis
**Best for**: Sharing industry insights and trends

**Structure**:
```
[Hook: Interesting observation or trend]

[Context: Why this matters or what you noticed]

[Analysis: Your interpretation - 2-4 points]

[Implication: What this means for the audience]

[Closing: Call to action or discussion prompt]
```

**Example**:
```
Noticed something interesting: 5 startups I've talked to are all using AI, but in completely different ways.

Company A: Replacing tasks to cut costs
Company B: Augmenting teams to boost efficiency
Company C: Exploring new possibilities to create value

The difference in outcomes? Massive.

The first group is fighting on price.
The last group is creating new categories.

Same technology. Different mindset. Totally different ceiling.

What's your company's AI strategy? 🚀
```

### Template 3: Question → Exploration
**Best for**: Engaging audience with thought-provoking topics

**Structure**:
```
[Hook: Provocative or intriguing question]

[Setup: Why you're asking this question]

[Exploration: Different perspectives or answers]

[Your take: Your personal perspective]

[Closing: Invite others to share their views]
```

**Example**:
```
Should product managers know how to code?

I've been wrestling with this question for months.

One engineer friend said: "You don't need to write code, but you need to understand technical cost."

A PM friend said: "You should at least be able to read code, or you can't truly collaborate."

My take:

The depth of technical knowledge you need depends on how far you want to go.

Execution-level PM → Understand technical cost
Strategy-level PM → See technical possibilities
Technical product PM → Deep dive into the tech itself

None is better. Just different paths.

Where do you stand on this? 🎯
```

### Template 4: Tip List → Value Delivery
**Best for**: Sharing actionable advice and practical tips

**Structure**:
```
[Hook: Promise of value or intriguing setup]

[Context: Brief background or why these tips matter]

[Tips: 3-5 numbered or bulleted points]

[Bonus/Context: Additional insight or personal note]

[Closing: Encourage trying or sharing]
```

**Example**:
```
After using AI for product design for 6 months, here are my 3 most practical use cases:

1. Brainstorming phase
Not asking AI for answers, but letting it help you ask the right questions

2. User research analysis
Feed interview transcripts to AI, quickly identify common insights

3. Documentation writing
Generate framework quickly, then refine details manually

Key takeaway: AI isn't a replacement, it's an accelerator ✨

How are you using AI in your work? Any unique use cases?

### Template 5: Contrarian View → Debate
**Best for**: Challenging common assumptions

**Structure**:
```
[Hook: State a contrarian or unpopular opinion]

[Setup: What everyone else believes]

[Your argument: Why you disagree - 2-3 points]

[Nuance: Acknowledge valid counterpoints]

[Closing: Open invitation for debate]
```

**Example**:
```
Unpopular opinion: Early-stage startups shouldn't aim for MVP.

Everyone says "ship fast, iterate fast." But I've seen too many teams fail because they were too "Minimum."

The problem:
• MVP becomes an excuse for sloppy work
• Users won't give you a second chance
• First impression determines viral potential

I prefer "SLC" - Simple, Lovable, Complete
Not minimal, but the simplest complete experience

What do you think? MVP or SLC? 🎯
```

## Content Development Workflows

### Workflow 1: From Fragmented Ideas to Complete Post
**When to use**: User provides scattered thoughts or bullet points

**Process**:
1. **Capture & Organize**: List all ideas and group related thoughts
2. **Find the Core**: Identify the central message or insight
3. **Choose Structure**: Select appropriate template based on content type
4. **Develop Narrative**: Expand ideas into coherent narrative flow
5. **Add Personality**: Inject personal voice and conversational elements
6. **Refine**: Ensure length, tone, and engagement elements are optimized

**Example Input**:
```
- AI is useful but people use it wrong
- Key is treating it as a partner not a tool
- Need conversational thinking
- Works much better for me
```

**Development Process**:
```
Core message: How to use AI effectively
Template: Observation → Analysis
Hook: Personal discovery or conversation with friend
Structure: Set up problem → Show different approaches → Share insight
Personality: Conversational, relatable examples
```

### Workflow 2: From Topic to Fully Developed Post
**When to use**: User provides a topic/theme to expand

**Process**:
1. **Explore the Topic**: Ask clarifying questions if needed
   - What angle interests you most?
   - Any specific experience or example?
   - What should readers take away?
2. **Find Personal Connection**: Link topic to personal experience or observation
3. **Develop Hook**: Create compelling opening that relates to audience
4. **Build Content**:
   - Add 2-3 key points with supporting details
   - Include examples or anecdotes
   - Balance insight with accessibility
5. **Create Engagement**: End with question or call to action
6. **Generate Image**: Create visual that reinforces message

**Example Input**:
```
Want to write about "product thinking"
```

**Exploration Questions**:
- Which aspect of product thinking do you want to emphasize? (user perspective/data-driven/iterative thinking/business balance)
- Any specific examples or stories to share?
- What should readers take away after reading?
