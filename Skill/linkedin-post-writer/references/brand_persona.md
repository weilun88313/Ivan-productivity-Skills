- Be authentic and genuine, showing both successes and learnings
- Use humor appropriately to make content engaging
- Avoid overly formal or academic language

### Content Structure

**Preferred Post Length**: 300-800 characters (Medium posts)

**Effective Opening Strategies**:
1. Start with a relatable scenario or question
2. Share a surprising insight or personal realization
3. Reference a recent experience or conversation

**Middle Content**:

- Break up text with line breaks for readability

**Closing Techniques**:
1. End with a thought-provoking question

5. Leave them with something to think about

### Language Patterns

**Preferred Expressions**:

- "In a conversation with..."
- "This made me realize..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "What I've learned is..."

**Power Words for Engagement**:
- "Surprising", "Unexpected", "Counterintuitive"

**Avoid**:
- Overly technical jargon without explanation
- Purely promotional content
- Clickbait or sensational language

- Corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, paradigm shift)
- Lengthy theoretical discussions without practical application
- Starting with "I hope this post finds you well" or similar clichés

### Formatting Guidelines

**Structure Elements**:
- Use line breaks to create visual breathing room (every 2-3 sentences)
- Include emojis sparingly (1-3 per post) to add personality
- Use bullet points (• or numbered lists) for clarity
- Bold key phrases for emphasis (but don't overuse)
- Include relevant hashtags (3-5) at the end

## Image Guidelines

### Two Image Styles

Every post generates two image styles for the user to choose from:

#### Style 1: Linear Dark Mode
Best for tech/AI/abstract concepts, frameworks, and formulas.
- **Background**: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a to #0a0a0a)
- **Accent color**: Violet-blue #6B75FF for highlights and connections
- **Elements**: Floating geometric shapes, data streams, glowing connection points
- **Style**: Minimalist, matte finish, abstract high-tech aesthetic
- **Labels**: Simple short labels only (2-5 words max)
- **Constraints**: NO UI chrome, NO dashboards, NO browser frames

#### Style 2: Photo Infographic (Apple Minimalism)
Best for personal branding, opinionated content, and human-centered topics.
- **Background**: Real-life setting (office, home workspace) with natural light
- **Person**: User's photo as character reference - can change expression/pose
- **Labels**: SF Pro style clean sans-serif, generous spacing, one accent color max
- **Colors**: White text, OR one accent (blue #0071E3, orange #FF6B35, green #00D68F)
- **Layout**: Generous negative space, precise alignment, minimal elements
- **Style**: Apple "Behind the Mac" aesthetic - premium, intentional, confident

### General Visual Principles
- Clean, modern, and professional aesthetic
- High quality and crisp imagery (2K, 16:9)
- Consistent visual language across posts
- Minimal text overlay
- Eye-catching but not distracting from the message
- Universal symbols that transcend language barriers

### Image Prompts Enhancement
When generating images, consider:
- The core message or metaphor of the post
- Visual elements that represent the main concept
- Which style (Linear Dark Mode vs Photo Infographic) best fits the content type
- Suitable for business social media context

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a post, ensure:
- [ ] Tone is conversational and approachable
- [ ] Contains personal insight or experience
- [ ] Provides clear value or takeaway
- [ ] Length is 300-800 characters
- [ ] Opening hooks the reader
- [ ] Closing invites engagement

- [ ] Overall feel is authentic and genuine
- [ ] No grammatical errors or typos
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud

## Examples of Voice

### Example 1: Good Post (Personal Story → Insight)

```
An intern asked me a question last week that stopped the entire room.

"Why are we spending 3 weeks perfecting a feature only 2% of users will touch?"

That moment made me realize:
• We often chase perfection at the cost of priority
• Sometimes outside perspective beats internal experience
• Courage doesn't come from seniority—it comes from authenticity

The best teams aren't the ones where everyone says "yes."

They're the ones where people feel safe asking "why."

Ever had a moment like this on your team? 💭
```

**Why it works**:
- Opens with specific, relatable scenario
- Uses conversational language
- Shares vulnerability and learning
- Provides structured insight with bullets
- Ends with engaging question
- Appropriate emoji usage
- Shows real human experience

### Example 2: Good Post (Observation → Analysis)

```
Noticed something interesting: 5 startups I've talked to are all using AI, but in completely different ways.

Company A: Replacing tasks to cut costs
Company B: Augmenting teams to boost efficiency
Company C: Exploring new possibilities to create value

The difference in outcomes? Massive.

The first group is fighting on price.
The last group is creating new categories.

Same technology. Different mindset. Totally different ceiling.

What's your company's AI strategy? 🚀
```

**Why it works**:
- Specific observation with numbers
- Clear contrast and structure
- Insight that sparks thinking
- Practical implications
- Invites discussion
- Short, punchy sentences

### Example 3: What to Avoid

```
According to recent industry reports, artificial intelligence technologies are rapidly transforming the landscape of product management. This comprehensive analysis will explore three key dimensions: technical architecture, application scenarios, and implementation frameworks...
```

**Why to avoid**:
- Too formal and academic
- Lacks personal connection
- Reads like a corporate report
- No hook or engagement
- Missing personality
- Uses buzzwords and jargon
- No invitation for interaction

### Example 4: Good Post (Question → Exploration)

```
Should product managers know how to code?

I've been wrestling with this question for months.

One engineer friend said: "You don't need to write code, but you need to understand technical cost."

A PM friend said: "You should at least be able to read code, or you can't truly collaborate."

My take:

The depth of technical knowledge you need depends on how far you want to go.

Execution-level PM → Understand technical cost
Strategy-level PM → See technical possibilities
Technical product PM → Deep dive into the tech itself

None is better. Just different paths.

Where do you stand on this? 🎯
```

**Why it works**:
- Opens with provocative question
- Shows different perspectives
- Personal reflection process
- Nuanced take (not black/white)
- Respects different viewpoints
- Invites healthy debate

## Writing Tips

### Hook Writing Framework

**Pattern 1: Surprise/Contrast**
- "Everyone says X. But I've found Y."
- "The opposite of what you'd expect happened."
- "Here's what nobody tells you about..."

**Pattern 2: Specific Moment**
- "Last Tuesday, something clicked for me..."
- "A conversation yesterday changed how I think about..."
- "I made a mistake that taught me..."

**Pattern 3: Observation**
- "I've noticed a pattern across..."
- "3 out of 5 companies I talked to..."
- "Something strange is happening in..."

**Pattern 4: Provocative Question**
- "What if we've been thinking about this wrong?"
- "Should we really be doing X?"
- "When did we all agree that...?"

### Closing Framework

**Pattern 1: Open-Ended Question**
- "What's your experience been?"
- "How do you approach this?"
- "Am I missing something here?"

**Pattern 2: Call to Share**
- "Drop your thoughts in the comments."
- "I'd love to hear your take on this."
- "What would you add to this list?"

**Pattern 3: Reflective Statement**
- "Something worth thinking about."
- "No easy answers, but worth exploring."
- "We're all figuring this out together."

## Grammar & Style Notes

- Use contractions (don't, can't, it's) for conversational tone
- Sentence fragments are OK when used intentionally for impact
- Start sentences with "And" or "But" when it flows naturally
- Use em dashes (—) or parentheses for asides
- Keep one idea per sentence when possible
- Read your post aloud—if it sounds stiff, rewrite it
- First person (I, we) is encouraged for authenticity
- Active voice over passive voice

## Cultural Considerations

Since these are English posts for an international audience:
- Avoid idioms or cultural references that don't translate globally
- Use examples that resonate across cultures
- When using specific numbers or data, consider global context
- Keep humor universal and professional
- Be mindful of different business practices across regions
- Use inclusive language
