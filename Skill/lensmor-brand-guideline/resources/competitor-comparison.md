# Lensmor Competitive Positioning

## Competitive Landscape

### Main Competitors

#### Competitor 1: Vendelux
**Overview:** Event intelligence platform focused on predicting event attendance for B2B companies. Similar concept to Lensmor but at enterprise price point.

**Their Strengths:**
- Well-funded, established brand in event intelligence space
- Comprehensive event database with strong historical data
- Robust predictive algorithms
- Enterprise-level support and customer success resources

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Extremely expensive: $20,000+/year minimum commitment
- Pricing puts it out of reach for mid-market and growing companies
- Can be overkill for companies attending fewer than 10-12 events annually
- Less flexible pricing/commitment terms

**Lensmor's Advantages:**
- **80%+ cost savings**: $899-$10,999 vs. $20K+ makes event intelligence accessible
- Flexible pricing tiers scale from startups to enterprises
- No long-term contracts on lower tiers – try before committing
- Reverse event discovery feature provides unique value
- Real-time data updates included at all price points

**Positioning Against Them:**
"Lensmor brings enterprise-grade event intelligence to growing B2B companies. While Vendelux serves Fortune 500 enterprises at $20K+/year, Lensmor delivers comparable attendee prediction, contact enrichment, and event discovery starting at just $899. Get the intelligence you need without the enterprise price tag."

#### Competitor 2: LinkedIn Sales Navigator
**Overview:** B2B prospecting and social selling tool with some event tracking capabilities via LinkedIn Events.

**Their Strengths:**
- Massive LinkedIn database with verified professional profiles
- Strong integration with LinkedIn messaging for outreach
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Familiar interface for sales teams already using LinkedIn
- Lead recommendations and account insights

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Not event-focused – events are a minor feature, not core functionality
- No attendee prediction or pre-event intelligence
- Can't reverse search events by exhibitor/company
- Limited event-specific data (just LinkedIn Events, misses most trade shows)
- Primarily for ongoing prospecting, not event-specific workflows

**Lensmor's Advantages:**
- **Event-vertical specialization**: Built specifically for trade show intelligence
- Predicts attendees before events publish lists (LinkedIn only shows who registered publicly)
- Covers 12,000+ global trade shows (LinkedIn Events is incomplete)
- Reverse discovery finds events based on target company participation
- Export-friendly for event-specific campaigns

**Positioning Against Them:**
"LinkedIn Sales Navigator is excellent for ongoing social selling, but wasn't built for event marketing. Lensmor specializes in trade show intelligence with attendee prediction, reverse event discovery, and comprehensive global event coverage that LinkedIn can't match. Use both: LinkedIn for daily prospecting, Lensmor for event-driven growth."

#### Competitor 3: ZoomInfo / Apollo
**Overview:** B2B contact databases providing company and contact information for outbound sales and marketing.

**Their Strengths:**
- Massive contact databases (hundreds of millions of records)
- Detailed technographic and firmographic data
- Strong CRM integrations
- Intent data and buying signals
- Sales engagement features

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Zero event-specific intelligence or context
- No way to identify which events companies/contacts attend
- No attendee prediction capabilities
- Static contact data without event timing
- Expensive for event-specific use cases ($10K-$20K+/year)

**Lensmor's Advantages:**
- **Event context**: Know WHERE and WHEN to reach prospects (at specific events)
- Attendee prediction provides early intelligence for meeting scheduling
- Reverse discovery reveals events where targets will be
- More cost-effective for event-focused go-to-market strategies
- Real-time updates tied to event schedules

**Positioning Against Them:**
"ZoomInfo and Apollo provide contact data, but can't tell you which trade shows your prospects attend. Lensmor adds the critical 'where' and 'when' – predict who will attend events months in advance, schedule meetings before the rush, and maximize event ROI. Complement your existing contact database with event-specific intelligence."

---

#### Competitor 4: General Event Directories (Eventbrite, 10times, etc.)
**Overview:** Event listing directories where organizers promote upcoming conferences and trade shows.

**Their Strengths:**
- Free to browse event listings
- Large databases of events across many categories
- Direct registration links to event websites
- Some user reviews and ratings

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Only show basic event information (dates, location, description)
- No exhibitor lists or attendee information
- No attendee prediction or intelligence
- Require manual research across multiple sites
- Consumer/community events mixed with B2B trade shows
- No filtering by exhibitor or company participation

**Lensmor's Advantages:**
- **Deep intelligence vs. basic listings**: Exhibitors, predicted attendees, contact data
- Reverse discovery (find events by company/exhibitor)
- B2B-focused filtering removes irrelevant consumer events
- Consolidated database eliminates multi-site research
- Actionable intelligence for pre-event outreach

**Positioning Against Them:**
"Event directories show you what events exist. Lensmor shows you which events YOUR prospects attend, who will be there, and how to reach them. Transform event selection from guesswork into data-driven strategy."
