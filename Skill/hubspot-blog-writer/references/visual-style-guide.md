# Visual Style Guide for Blog Images

ALL generated images must strictly follow this style system.

## Aesthetic
- Technical data visualization and conceptual schematic, inspired by Linear design
- Clean, dark mode, matte finish. High-tech blueprint minimalist
- Floating data clusters, interconnected nodes, stacks of conceptual information cards, or abstract flow diagrams suspended in a dark void
- Extremely subtle, barely visible technical grid lines in the background

## Color Palette
| Element | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Background | Deep charcoal |
| Data Structures | Slightly lighter matte grey |
| Accent | #6B75FF (violet-blue) for key highlights, connections, and active data points |

## Micro-Details
- Small, clean icons, tiny status dots (e.g., purple dot for active), and thin connecting lines
- Create a sense of rich information structure

## Text Strategy
- **Keywords Only**: Only keep the title and tag text. NO detailed descriptive text
- **Legibility**: No blurry text. Keep it clean and structured

## Constraints (Negative Prompts)
- **NO PRODUCT UI CHROME**: No navigation bars, sidebars, browser frames, buttons, or dashboard widgets
- **NO FAKE APPS**: No menus, no detailed interfaces
