# Visual Style Guide for Blog Images

ALL generated images must strictly follow this style system.

---

## Cover Image Style

Cover images are purely abstract — NO text, NO UI, NO literal depictions. Translate the article's theme into visual metaphor.

### Prompt Template

When generating a cover image, combine this style prefix with a conceptual description of the article's theme:

```
Style: Abstract high-tech cover art, inspired by "Linear" app design. Dark mode UI, minimalist, clean, futuristic.
Color Palette: Primary glowing light is hex code #6B75FF (neon violet-blue indigo). Soft, diffused glow on deep charcoal background.
[THEME CONCEPT — describe the article's topic as abstract visual elements, e.g. "interconnected intelligence nodes flowing into a central analysis hub"]. Translate the meaning into glowing geometric data streams, interconnected nodes, floating frosted glass shapes, and abstract light trails. Composition representing data flow in a sophisticated system.
Environment: Deep black void. Very subtle, barely visible isometric grid. Shallow depth of field, bokeh effects.
Negative Constraints: NO TEXT, NO LETTERS, NO WORDS, NO CHARACTERS. Purely abstract visual shapes.
```

### Example

Article: "What Is Event Intelligence?"
→ Theme concept: "scattered event data signals converging into a crystalline intelligence hub, with radiating insight pathways"

## Inline Image Style

Inline images visualize specific concepts within the article — more structured and informational than covers.

### Aesthetic
- Technical data visualization and conceptual schematic, inspired by Linear design
- Clean, dark mode, matte finish. High-tech blueprint minimalist
- Floating data clusters, interconnected nodes, stacks of conceptual information cards, or abstract flow diagrams suspended in a dark void
- Extremely subtle, barely visible technical grid lines in the background

### Color Palette
| Element | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Background | Deep charcoal |
| Data Structures | Slightly lighter matte grey |
| Accent | #6B75FF (violet-blue) for key highlights, connections, and active data points |

### Micro-Details
- Small, clean icons, tiny status dots (e.g., purple dot for active), and thin connecting lines
- Create a sense of rich information structure

### Text Strategy
- **Keywords Only**: Only keep the title and tag text. NO detailed descriptive text
- **Legibility**: No blurry text. Keep it clean and structured

## Shared Constraints (Both Cover & Inline)
- **NO PRODUCT UI CHROME**: No navigation bars, sidebars, browser frames, buttons, or dashboard widgets
- **NO FAKE APPS**: No menus, no detailed interfaces
- **Resolution**: 2K, 16:9 aspect ratio
