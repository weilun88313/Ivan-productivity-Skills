## Product Overview

### What is Lensmor?

**Product Type:** SaaS Software Platform

**Core Description:**
Lensmor is a B2B event intelligence and lead generation platform that helps companies maximize their trade show ROI. Using proprietary algorithms and real-time data, Lensmor predicts attendee lists, enables reverse event discovery through exhibitor data, and provides comprehensive global event intelligence to help B2B companies connect with the right prospects at the right events.

**Target Audience:**
B2B companies seeking to acquire customers through trade shows and industry events, including:
- Sales and marketing teams targeting specific accounts or industries
- Event marketing managers planning exhibition strategies
- Business development professionals seeking qualified leads
- Enterprise companies with significant event marketing budgets

**Key Features:**
- **Reverse Event Discovery**: Find which trade shows your target customers and competitors attend by searching exhibitor databases
- **Attendee Prediction Engine**: Proprietary algorithms predict attendee lists by combining historical data, social media monitoring, and official event partnerships
- **Contact Enrichment**: Access verified contact information for predicted attendees with downloadable contact data
- **Global Event Intelligence**: Search and filter worldwide trade shows, exhibitors, and attendees with advanced criteria
- **Real-time Data Updates**: Dynamic, continuously updated data versus static purchased lists

**Value Proposition:**
Lensmor eliminates the costly trial-and-error approach to trade show participation. B2B companies struggle with not knowing who will attend events, inability to prepare effectively, limited on-site networking time, and missing key decision-makers. Lensmor solves these challenges by providing pre-event intelligence, enabling targeted preparation, and significantly improving event ROI at a fraction of the cost of alternatives like Vendelux ($20K+/year).

### Product Positioning

**Mission Statement:**
To empower B2B companies with actionable event intelligence, transforming trade shows from expensive gambles into strategic, high-ROI growth channels.

**Vision:**
Become the essential event intelligence platform for every B2B company that participates in trade shows, making event-driven growth predictable, measurable, and accessible to businesses of all sizes.

**Core Values:**
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: We provide real-time, accurate intelligence that replaces guesswork with confidence
- **Customer ROI Focus**: Every feature is designed to maximize event investment returns and reduce wasted resources
- **Accessibility**: Premium event intelligence shouldn't cost $20K+/year – we make it affordable for growing businesses
- **Continuous Innovation**: We leverage cutting-edge algorithms and data sources to stay ahead of market needs
- **Transparency**: Clear pricing, honest data sourcing, and straightforward value propositions

**Competitive Differentiation:**
Unlike general B2B data platforms (LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo, Apollo) that lack event context, or expensive event-specific tools (Vendelux at $20K+/year), Lensmor uniquely combines:
1. **Event-Vertical Specialization**: Exclusively focused on trade show intelligence with deeper, more accurate event data
2. **Predictive Attendee Intelligence**: Proprietary algorithms forecast who will attend events before they're publicly listed
3. **Reverse Discovery**: Find events by searching which shows your target companies exhibit at
4. **Global Coverage**: Comprehensive worldwide event database with detailed exhibitor and attendee information
5. **Competitive Pricing**: Premium features at a fraction of competitors' cost, starting at $499
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic data that refreshes continuously, not static purchased lists

  - Minimum size: 24x24px for digital, 0.5" for print

- **Wordmark Only**: "Lensmor" text without icon (if space-constrained)
  - When to use: Text-heavy documents, email signatures, inline mentions

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Brand Voice

**Tone Attributes:**

- **Professional & Authoritative**: We speak with confidence and expertise in event intelligence and B2B lead generation. Our tone conveys that we deeply understand the challenges and know the solutions.
  - Example: "Lensmor's predictive algorithms analyze historical attendance data, social signals, and event partnerships to forecast attendee lists with industry-leading accuracy."

- **Data-Driven & Precise**: We back claims with specifics, use concrete numbers, and avoid vague promises. Every statement should feel grounded in real capability.
  - Example: "Access 150,000 enriched contacts across 40 global events annually" vs. "Get lots of contact information"

- **Results-Focused**: We emphasize business outcomes, ROI, and measurable impact. Talk about what customers achieve, not just what features exist.
  - Example: "Reduce event research time from weeks to hours" vs. "We have a search feature"

- **Clear & Direct**: Use straightforward language that busy executives can quickly understand. Avoid marketing fluff, jargon (unless industry-standard), and unnecessary wordiness.
  - Example: "Find which events your target customers attend" vs. "Leverage our comprehensive discovery paradigm to identify relevant touchpoint opportunities"

- **Confident But Not Arrogant**: We're expert leaders in event intelligence, but we respect our customers' intelligence and don't oversell or hype.
  - Example: "Unlike static purchased lists, Lensmor data updates continuously" vs. "We're revolutionizing everything with the most amazing data in the world!"

**Voice Characteristics:**

- **We are**:
  - Professional and businesslike
  - Knowledgeable and data-informed
  - Efficient and respectful of time
  - Transparent about capabilities and pricing
  - Focused on customer success and ROI

- **We are not**:
  - Casual, chatty, or overly friendly
  - Vague or using excessive marketing speak
  - Pushy, aggressive, or using FOMO tactics
  - Making unrealistic promises or guarantees
  - Technical to the point of being incomprehensible

### Writing Principles

1. **Lead with Business Value**: Always start with the customer benefit, not the feature. Explain what outcomes users achieve, then how Lensmor delivers it.
   - ✅ Good: "Identify high-value prospects before the event starts, so you can schedule meetings with decision-makers instead of collecting random business cards."
   - ❌ Avoid: "Our platform has an attendee prediction feature that uses algorithms."

2. **Use Specific Numbers**: Replace vague claims with concrete data points. Quantify benefits whenever possible.
   - ✅ Good: "Save 15+ hours of pre-event research per show"
   - ❌ Avoid: "Save time on research"

3. **Write in Active Voice**: Use direct, active constructions that emphasize action and agency.
   - ✅ Good: "Lensmor predicts attendee lists using proprietary algorithms"
   - ❌ Avoid: "Attendee lists are predicted by Lensmor's proprietary algorithms"

4. **Respect Your Audience's Intelligence**: B2B decision-makers are smart professionals. Don't over-explain or patronize. Be direct and substantive.
   - ✅ Good: "Reverse search exhibitors to find relevant events"
   - ❌ Avoid: "You know how sometimes you might want to find events? Well, we have this really cool feature that lets you do that by searching!"

5. **Stay Factual and Honest**: Never exaggerate capabilities. If there's a limitation, acknowledge it professionally. Build trust through transparency.
   - ✅ Good: "Attendee predictions are based on historical data and social signals – accuracy improves with event popularity and data availability"
   - ❌ Avoid: "100% perfect predictions of every single attendee at any event!"
