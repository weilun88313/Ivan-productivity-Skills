# Lensmor Product Details

## Product Overview

**Full Product Name:** Lensmor
**Product Category:** B2B Event Intelligence & Lead Generation Platform
**Target Market:** B2B companies seeking to optimize trade show participation and maximize event ROI
**Platform Type:** Web-based SaaS application

## Detailed Feature Descriptions

### Core Features

#### Feature 1: Reverse Event Discovery
**Description:** Find relevant trade shows by searching which companies exhibit at them. Instead of browsing endless event listings, input your target customer companies or competitors, and Lensmor reveals which events they participate in. This reverse-lookup approach ensures you attend events where your prospects actually gather.

**User Benefits:**
- Eliminate guesswork about which events to attend
- Discover niche industry events you didn't know existed
- Validate event selection with data about competitor participation
- Reduce wasted budget on low-ROI events

**Use Cases:**
- Sales team wants to know which events their top 50 target accounts attend
- Marketing manager needs to identify where competitors are exhibiting
- Event planner building annual trade show calendar for the year
- New market entry: discovering relevant events in an unfamiliar industry

**Key Differentiators:**
Unlike event directories that only offer keyword search, Lensmor's reverse discovery uses exhibitor data to surface events based on who attends, not just event names or descriptions. This exhibitor-first approach is unique in the market.

#### Feature 2: Attendee Prediction Engine
**Description:** Proprietary algorithms forecast who will attend upcoming trade shows before official attendee lists are published. By analyzing historical attendance patterns, social media signals (LinkedIn activity, event hashtags, speaker announcements), and official event partnerships, Lensmor predicts attendee lists with high accuracy weeks or months before the event.

**User Benefits:**
- Contact key prospects before the event rush
- Schedule meetings in advance instead of hoping for booth traffic
- Prioritize which events to attend based on predicted attendee quality
- Gain competitive advantage with early prospect intelligence

**Use Cases:**
- Pre-event outreach: email predicted attendees to schedule booth meetings
- Account-based marketing: identify which target accounts will attend
- Competitive intelligence: see which competitors are likely attending
- Event ROI forecasting: evaluate potential reach before committing budget

**Key Differentiators:**
Most event platforms only show exhibitor lists, not attendees. Lensmor's predictive approach gives customers intelligence that's typically unavailable until after registration closes – by then, top prospects may have booked their calendars. This early intelligence is a game-changer for event marketing.

#### Feature 3: Contact Enrichment & Export
**Description:** Access verified contact information (email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles) for predicted attendees and exhibitor contacts. All contact data can be exported to CSV for integration with CRM systems, marketing automation platforms, or custom outreach tools.

**User Benefits:**
- Skip manual contact research – get enriched data instantly
- Higher email deliverability with verified addresses
- Seamless CRM integration via CSV export
- Save dozens of hours on contact lookup

**Use Cases:**
- Export predicted attendee contacts for pre-event email campaign
- Download exhibitor contact lists for partnership outreach
- Import contacts into Salesforce/HubSpot for automated nurture flows
- Build targeted LinkedIn outreach lists

**Key Differentiators:**
While competitors often charge per contact or offer limited exports, Lensmor provides generous contact credits across all paid plans. Business plan includes 50,000 contacts annually – significantly more than typical B2B data platforms at this price point.

---

#### Feature 4: Global Event Search & Filtering
**Description:** Search and filter through 12,000+ trade shows worldwide using advanced criteria: industry, location, event size, date range, exhibitor count, and more. Each event listing includes comprehensive details: venue, dates, expected attendance, exhibitor lists, event history, and contact information.

**User Benefits:**
- Centralized database eliminates need to visit individual event websites
- Advanced filters surface highly relevant events quickly
- Historical data helps assess event credibility and growth trends
- Compare multiple events side-by-side for better decision-making

**Use Cases:**
- Annual planning: build 12-month event calendar filtered by industry and region
- Budget allocation: compare event sizes and costs to optimize spend
- Market research: discover emerging events in new territories
- Competitive tracking: monitor which events competitors sponsor

**Key Differentiators:**
Lensmor aggregates event data from multiple sources into one searchable interface, while most competitors focus on a single region or require manual research across multiple sites. Global coverage with deep exhibitor data is rare in the market.

---

#### Feature 5: Real-Time Data Updates
**Description:** Event data, exhibitor lists, and attendee predictions continuously update as new information becomes available. Unlike static purchased lists that grow stale, Lensmor's dynamic database reflects the latest changes: new exhibitors, updated venues, speaker announcements, and revised dates.

**User Benefits:**
- Always work with current, accurate information
- Automatic notifications when target events or companies change
- No need to purchase updated lists repeatedly
- Confidence in data quality and freshness

**Use Cases:**
- Monitor target events for exhibitor additions (potential new prospects)
- Track when key accounts register for upcoming events
- Stay informed about event cancellations or date changes
- Receive alerts when competitors enter new events

**Key Differentiators:**
Traditional lead list vendors sell one-time exports that immediately become outdated. Lensmor's subscription model includes continuous updates, making it more valuable over time. This is especially critical in the post-pandemic era where event schedules change frequently.
