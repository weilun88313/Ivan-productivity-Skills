# Brand Persona & Writing Style Guide (X / Twitter)

This document defines the personal brand, writing style, and content strategy for X (Twitter) posts in English.

## Personal Brand Identity

### Core Positioning
- **Industry Focus**: AI/New Technology, Entrepreneurship/Business, Product/Design
- **Tone**: Sharp, direct, and conversational while staying approachable
- **Voice**: Concise and punchy with clear opinions backed by real experience
- **Perspective**: Personal observations and practical insights over theoretical takes

### Target Audience

- Product managers and designers
- AI enthusiasts and practitioners
- Business leaders interested in innovation

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone & Voice Characteristics

**Sharp & Conversational Style**
- Every word earns its place - cut ruthlessly
- Lead with the strongest thought, not a preamble
- Have a clear opinion; lukewarm takes don't travel
- Be authentic - share real wins and real failures
- Use "you" and "I" to keep it human
- Write like you talk, not like you present

### Platform-Specific Conventions

Twitter rewards density. Key differences from LinkedIn:

| Dimension | LinkedIn | Twitter |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Length | 300-800 chars | 100-280 chars (single) |
| Tone | Professional-friendly | Direct-punchy |
| Structure | Paragraphs with breaks | Short lines, fragments OK |
| Emojis | 1-3 decorative | 0-2 functional |
| Hashtags | 3-5 at end | 0-2 max, only if relevant |
| CTA style | Question to invite discussion | Provocative prompt or none |

### Language Patterns

**Preferred Expressions**:
- "Hot take:"
- "Something I keep seeing..."
- "Unpopular opinion:"
- "The real reason..."
- "Nobody talks about this, but..."
- "I was wrong about..."
- "Here's what actually works:"

**Power Words**:
- "Actually", "Counterintuitive", "Underrated"
- "Simple", "Brutal", "Honest"
- "Most people", "The real", "Hidden"

**Avoid**:
- Thread-bro clichés ("Let me explain", "Read this before it's too late")
- Engagement bait ("RT if you agree", "Like if...")
- Hashtag spam (>2 hashtags)
- Corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, paradigm shift)
- Excessive punctuation or ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Self-promotion without value ("Check out my new...")
- Vague motivational content without substance

### Formatting Guidelines

- Line breaks between thoughts for rhythm
- Sentence fragments for impact - use intentionally
- Emojis only when functional (pointing, emphasis), not decorative
- 0-2 hashtags max, placed naturally or at end
- Bold claims followed by specific evidence
- Numbers and specifics beat generalizations

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Written entirely in English with natural phrasing
- [ ] First line grabs attention immediately
- [ ] Contains a clear, specific insight (not vague)
- [ ] Concise - no filler words or unnecessary setup
- [ ] Has a point of view (not generic or safe)
- [ ] Tone is direct and human, not corporate
- [ ] Would not trigger blocks, mutes, or "not interested"
- [ ] Single tweet: under 280 chars; thread: 3-5 tweets max
- [ ] Each thread tweet works as a standalone thought
- [ ] No engagement bait or manipulative patterns

## Voice Examples

### Good (Sharp Observation)
```
Most "AI strategies" are just automation with better branding.

The real question isn't "where can we add AI?"

It's "where are humans doing work that shouldn't require thinking?"

Different question. Completely different results.
```

### Good (Personal Lesson)
```
Spent 3 months building a feature nobody asked for.

The data was clear. Usage: 23 people/day.

Lesson: falling in love with your solution is the most expensive mistake in product.
```

### Good (Contrarian Take)
```
Unpopular opinion: most startups don't have a growth problem.

They have a "built something nobody wants" problem wrapped in growth language.
```

### What to Avoid
```
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, it is increasingly important for businesses to embrace digital transformation and leverage AI-powered solutions to drive synergistic outcomes...
```
Why: corporate tone, no personal voice, no specific insight, buzzword-heavy.
