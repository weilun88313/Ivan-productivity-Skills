## Cross-Account Rules

1. **No same-day collision**: Personal and company accounts should not post about the same topic on the same day
2. **Complementary angles**: When covering the same broad theme, personal = story/experience, company = data/value
3. **Jike is always personal**: No company content on Jike (Chinese personal community, irrelevant for B2B English audience)
4. **Cross-promotion is rare**: Only link company content from personal when genuinely relevant (e.g., major launch). Never the other direction.
