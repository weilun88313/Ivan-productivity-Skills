## LinkedIn — Company Page

### By Follower Count

| Metric | < 500 followers | 500-2K | 2K-10K | 10K+ |
|--------|----------------|--------|--------|------|
| Impressions per post | 100-400 | 300-1.5K | 1K-5K | 3K-15K+ |

## Twitter/X — Company Account

### By Follower Count

| Metric | < 1K followers | 1K-5K | 5K-20K | 20K+ |
|--------|---------------|-------|--------|------|
| Impressions per tweet | 50-300 | 200-1.5K | 800-5K | 3K-20K+ |
| Engagement rate | 0.5-2% | 0.5-1.5% | 0.3-1.2% | 0.2-1% |
| Avg likes | 1-5 | 3-12 | 8-30 | 20-100+ |

**Note**: Like LinkedIn company pages, company Twitter accounts get lower organic reach. Best-performing company accounts (Stripe, Linear, Vercel) succeed by being genuinely useful and opinionated, not just promotional.

## Jike — Personal Account

### General Benchmarks

| Metric | New account (< 3 months) | Established (3-12 months) | Active community member (1yr+) |

| Comments per post | 0-3 | 2-10 | 5-30+ |

### Platform-Specific Notes

- Jike rewards **authenticity and community participation** over polish

- Topic groups (圈子) can amplify reach significantly when content fits
- Peak engagement: weekday evenings (8-10 PM CST), weekend mornings

## How to Use These Benchmarks

1. **Set realistic goals**: Compare your metrics against the appropriate follower tier, not against viral outliers
2. **Track trends, not absolutes**: A 50% improvement in engagement rate matters more than hitting a specific number
3. **Account for content type**: Compare like-for-like (text vs text, thread vs thread)
4. **Update quarterly**: Platform dynamics change; refresh these benchmarks every 3 months
5. **Focus on rate metrics**: Engagement rate and growth rate matter more than absolute numbers at early stages
